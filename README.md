# Expensify Style Guide

Did you ever wonder what your code should look like? Wonder no more! This repo contains specific language styles to
define the expected coding standard for software projects managed by Expensify. We expect all engineers (internal and
external) to submit code that aligns with these coding standards.

These style guides form Expensify's internal expectations to assist developers working with Expensify. External
contributions are not accepted; pull requests will be closed without comment. These guidelines are optimizing for
Expensify's internal needs.
